# microbomb

## About
Using an Arduino Pro Mini, or any Arduino/Arduino clone that has USB HID support, this short piece of code opens a notepad file, inputs a fork bomb, saves the file, and runs it. This effectively kills the Windows machine within 10 seconds.
This only works after the driver has been installed automatically (or rather failed to be installed, as it fails after ~15 seconds of searching.
